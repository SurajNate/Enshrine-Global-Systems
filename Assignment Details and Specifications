Assignment: Multi-Agent AI System Using Google ADK (2–3 Days)

Build a multi-agent system using Google ADK that takes a user goal, creates a plan, then routes data between agents, each enriching the output of the previous, until the goal is achieved. Agents must decide the order, pass results, and iterate if the goal isn’t met.

Example:
“Find the next SpaceX launch, check weather at that location, then summarize if it may be delayed.”

Use at least 2–3 public APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, CoinGecko, NewsAPI, SpaceX). Agents must not work in isolation—each must depend on the previous agent’s output.

Deliverables:

Code (modular agents: planner + enrichment agents)

Docs: flow, agent logic, APIs, setup

Evals: test goal satisfaction & agent trajectory

Evaluation:

Agent chaining & data enrichment

Planner’s routing logic

Iterative refinement to reach final goal

Code quality, evals, and docs

Submit: GitHub or ZIP with code, README, and 1–2 evals. Use .env for API keys.

You have the creative freedom to use any open source / free API's !!
